# To-Do List Application
#### Video Demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--RiEYFeql4
#### Description:
The To-Do List Application is a simple command-line tool designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. Users can add new tasks, view existing tasks, and delete tasks that are no longer needed. The program is built using Python and follows a modular structure with functions for adding, viewing, and deleting tasks.

### Features:
- **Add Task:** Allows users to add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **View Tasks:** Displays all the tasks in the current list.
- **Delete Task:** Enables users to remove tasks that have been completed or are no longer relevant.

### Project Structure:
- **project.py:** Contains the main program logic and the core functions.
- **test_project.py:** Includes test cases for the functions in `project.py` using `pytest`.
- **requirements.txt:** Lists the external libraries required for the project, which currently only includes `pytest`.

### Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the program using the command `python project.py`.
4. To run the tests, use the command `pytest`.

This project demonstrates fundamental Python skills, including function design, test-driven development, and command-line interaction.
